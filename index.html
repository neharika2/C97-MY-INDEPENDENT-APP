        <p>Delhi is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and was the seat of power of many dynasties and rulers since the 6th century BCE. As a result of the rise and fall of mighty empires and powerful kingdoms, Delhi is well-known for its past glories, cultural heritage and archeological splendors but has lost much of its natural heritage. It is expected to be the most populated capital city in the world by 2030.The period of 73 years of development led to further loss of natural heritage and is threatening the life supporting potentials of two major landforms, the Ridge and the Yamuna River.</p></h6>

            <h4 class="text-success text-left "> <p> With an objective to establish historically representative natural ecosystems within a defined space to achieve ecological integrity, and to repair habitats that have been damaged by human activities, the restoration work in Phase I of Yamuna Biodiversity Park was started in 2002. The area was highly alkaline with extremely saline underground water. The region harbored only a few species of halophytes (Salt loving bushes) and common weeds. To restore the pristine glory of Yamuna river basin, various restoration strategies and principles for reconstruction of ecosystems and ecological succession were utilized. Different forest types, wetlands, grasslands and marshes were developed.
                To start the successional processes, grasses of 25 species were planted. Seeds of wild plant species were collected from the natural forest floor and were germinated. Based on the species' life history traits such as seed size and longevity, germination requirements, relative growth rate, shade dependence, ability to tolerate moisture stress, strategies for massive plantation were developed. Wetlands, which simulate natural water bodies, were created in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park. Increase in complexity, diversity and abundance in floral components of various plant communities of Yamuna Biodiversity Park led to enhanced faunal diversity. The habitat processing enabled many bird species to find their suitable habitat thereby enhancing the size of food web and trophic structure.
